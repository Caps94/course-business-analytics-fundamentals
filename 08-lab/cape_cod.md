# Cape Cod

Beverly owns a vacation home in Cape Cod that she wishes to rent for the period May 1st to August 31st. She has solicited a number of bids, each having the following form:

- the day the rental starts (a rental day start at 3 P.M.),
- the day the rental ends (checkout time is noon), and
- the total amount of the bid (in dollars).

Beverly wants to identify a selection of bids that maximises her total revenue. Can you help her finding the best bids to accept?
