# Enterpreneur's problem

An entrepreneur faces the following problem.
In each of $T$ periods, he can buy, sell, or hold for later sale some commodity, subject to the following constraints. In each period $i$ he can buy at most $\alpha_i$ units of the commodity, can holdover at most $\beta_i$ units of the commodity for the next period, and must sell at least $\gamma_i$ units (perhaps due to prior agreements). 

The enterpreneur cannot sell the commodity in the same period in which he buys it. Assuming that $p_i$, $w_i$, and $s_i$ denote the purchase cost, inventory carrying cost, and selling price per unit in period $i$, what buy-sell policy should the entreprenuer adopt to maximize total profit in the $T$ periods? 

Formulate this problem as a minimum cost flow problem for $T=4$.
