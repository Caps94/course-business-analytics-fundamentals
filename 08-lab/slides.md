How can we model this decision problem as a shortest path problem?

> [!TIP]
> Draw the nodes and arcs of the network and indicate the costs (negative revenue) for each arc.

How can we model this decision problem as a minimum flow problem?

> [!NOTE]
> The minimum flow problem is a close relative of the maximum flow problem
> with non-negative lower bounds on arc flows. 
> In the minimum flow problem, we wish to send the minimum amount of flow
> from the source to the sink, while satisfying given lower on arc flows.

> [!TIP]
> Draw the nodes and arcs of the network and indicate the lower bounds on arcs.

How can we model this decision problem as a min-cost network flow problem?

> [!TIP]
> Draw the nodes and arcs of the network and indicate supply and demand at nodes, costs, lower bounds, and upper bounds on arcs.
