# Air cargo

A cargo plane has three compartments for storing cargo: front, center, and back. These compartments have capacity limits on both weight and space, as summarized below:

| Compartment | Weight Capacity (Tons) | Space Capacity (Cubic Feet) |
|--------|----|------|
| Front  | 12 | 7000 |
| Center | 18 | 9000 |
| Back   | 10 | 5000 |

Furthermore, the weight of the cargo in the respective compartments must be the same proportion of that compartmentâ€™s weight capacity to maintain the balance of the airplane.

The following four cargoes have been offered for shipment on an upcoming flight as space is available:

| Cargo | Weight (Tons) | Volume (Cubic Feet/Ton) | Profit ($/Ton) |
|---|----|-----|-----|
| 1 | 20 | 500 | 320 |
| 2 | 16 | 700 | 400 |
| 3 | 25 | 600 | 360 |
| 4 | 13 | 400 | 290 |

Any portion of these cargoes can be accepted. The objective is to determine how much (if any) of each cargo should be accepted and how to distribute each among the compartments to maximize the total profit for the flight.

1. Formulate a linear programming model for this problem.
2. Solve this model by the simplex method to find one of its multiple optimal solutions.
