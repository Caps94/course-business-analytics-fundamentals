# Lizzie’s Dairy

Lizzie’s Dairy produces cream cheese and cottage cheese. Milk and cream are blended to produce these two products. Both high-fat and low-fat milk can be used to produce cream cheese and cottage cheese. High-fat milk is 60% fat; low-fat milk is 30% fat. The milk used to produce cream cheese must average at least 50% fat and that for cottage cheese, at least 35% fat. At least 40% (by weight) of the inputs to cream cheese and at least 20% (by weight) of the inputs to cottage cheese must be cream. 

Both cottage cheese and cream cheese are produced by putting milk and cream through the cheese machine. It costs 40¢ to process 1 lb of inputs into a pound of cream cheese. It costs 40¢ to produce 1 lb of cottage cheese, but every pound of input for cottage cheese yields 0.9 lb of cottage cheese and 0.1 lb of waste. Cream can be produced by evaporating high-fat and low-fat milk. It costs 40¢ to evaporate 1 lb of high-fat milk.  Each pound of high-fat milk that is evaporated yields 0.6 lb of cream. It costs 40¢ to evaporate 1 lb of low-fat milk. Each pound of low-fat milk that is evaporated yields 0.3 lb of cream. Each day, up to 3,000 lb of input may be sent through the cheese machine. 

Each day, at least 1,000 lb of cottage cheese and 1,000 lb of cream cheese must be produced. Up to 1,500 lb of cream cheese and 2,000 lb of cottage cheese can be sold each day. Cottage cheese is sold for $1.20/lb and cream cheese for $1.50/lb. High-fat milk is purchased for 80¢/lb and low-fat milk for 40¢/lb. The evaporator can process at most 2,000 lb of milk daily.
