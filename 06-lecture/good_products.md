# Good Products Company

The Research and Development Division of the Good Products Company has developed three possible new products. However, to avoid undue diversification of the companyâ€™s product line, management has imposed the following restriction.

**Restriction 1:** From the three possible new products, at most two should be chosen to be produced. 

Each of these products can be produced in either of two plants. For administrative reasons, management has imposed a second restriction in this regard.

**Restriction 2:** Just one of the two plants should be chosen to be the sole producer of the new products. 

The production cost per unit of each product would be essentially the same in the two plants. However, because of differences in their production facilities, the number of hours of production time needed per unit of each product might differ between the two plants. 

|                 | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 | Time Available |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------| 
| Plant 1         | 3 hours   | 4 hours   | 2 hours   | 30 hours       |
| Plant 2         | 4 hours   | 6 hours   | 2 hours   | 40 hours       |
| Unit profit     | 5 T$      | 7 T$      | 3 T$      |                |
| Sales potential | 7 units   | 5 units   | 9 units   |                |

These data are given in the table, along with other relevant information, including marketing estimates of the number of units of each product that could be sold per week if it is produced. The objective is to choose the products, the plant, and the production rates of the chosen products so as to maximize total profit
