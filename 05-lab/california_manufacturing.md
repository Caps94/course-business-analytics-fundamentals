# California Manufacturing Company

The California Manufacturing Company is considering expansion by building a new factory in either Los Angeles or San Francisco, or perhaps even in both cities. It also is considering building at most one new warehouse, but the choice of location is restricted to a city where a new factory is being built. The net present value (total profitability considering the time value of money) of each of these alternatives and the capital required (already included in the net present value) for the respective investments are shown below.

| Factory location   | Net present value | Costs         |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Los Angeles        | 9 million USD     | 6 million USD |
| San Francisco      | 5 million USD     | 3 million USD |


| Warehouse location | Net present value | Costs         |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Los Angeles        | 6 million USD     | 5 million USD |
| San Francisco      | 4 million USD     | 2 million USD |

The total capital available is $10 million. The objective is to find the feasible combination of alternatives that maximizes the total net present value.
