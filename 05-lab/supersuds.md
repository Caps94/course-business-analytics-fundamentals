# Supersuds Corporation

The Supersuds Corporation is developing its marketing plans for next yearâ€™s new products. For three of these products, the decision has been made to purchase a total of five TV spots for commercials on national television networks. The problem we will focus on is how to allocate the five spots to these three products, with a maximum of three spots (and a minimum of zero) for each product.

The table shows the estimated impact of allocating zero, one, two, or three spots to each product. This impact is measured in terms of the profit (in units of millions of dollars) from the additional sales that would result from the spots, considering also the cost of producing the commercial and purchasing the spots. 

| Number of spots | Profit for product 1 | Profit for product 2 | Profit for product 3 |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 0               | 0                    | 0                    | 0                    |
| 1               | 1                    | 0                    | -1                   |
| 2               | 3                    | 2                    | 2                    |
| 3               | 3                    | 3                    | 4                    |

The objective is to allocate five spots to the products so as to maximize the total profit.
