# Southern Confederation of Kibbutzim

The Southern Confederation of Kibbutzim is a group of three kibbutzim
(communal farming communities) in Israel. Overall planning for this group is done in its
Coordinating Technical Office. This office currently is planning agricultural production for
the coming year.

The agricultural output of each kibbutz is limited by both the amount of available irrigable
land and the quantity of water allocated for irrigation by the Water Commissioner (a national government official). 

| Kibbutz | Usable Land (Acres) | Water Allocation (Acre Feet) |
|---|-----|-----|
| 1 | 400 | 600 |
| 2 | 600 | 800 |
| 3 | 300 | 375 |

The crops suited for this region include sugar beets, cotton, and sorghum, and these
are the three being considered for the upcoming season. These crops differ primarily in
their expected net return per acre and their consumption of water. In addition, the Ministry
of Agriculture has set a maximum quota for the total acreage that can be devoted to each of
these crops by the Southern Confederation of Kibbutzim.

| Crop | Maximum Quota (Acres) | Water Consumption (Acre Feet/Acre) | Net Return ($/Acre) |
|-------------|-----|---|-------|
| Sugar beets | 600 | 3 | 1,000 |
| Cotton      | 500 | 2 |   750 |
| Sorghum     | 325 | 1 |   250 |

Because of the limited water available for irrigation, the Southern Confederation of
Kibbutzim will not be able to use all its irrigable land for planting crops in the upcoming
season. To ensure equity between the three kibbutzim, it has been agreed that every kibbutz
will plant the same proportion of its available irrigable land. For example, if kibbutz 1 plants
200 of its available 400 acres, then kibbutz 2 must plant 300 of its 600 acres, while kibbutz 3 
plants 150 acres of its 300 acres. However, any combination of the crops may be
grown at any of the kibbutzim. The job facing the Coordinating Technical Office is to plan
how many acres to devote to each crop at the respective kibbutzim while satisfying the
given restrictions. The objective is to maximize the total net return to the Southern Con-
federation of Kibbutzim as a whole.
