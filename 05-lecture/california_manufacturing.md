# California Manufacturing Company

The California Manufacturing Company is considering expansion by build- ing a new factory in either Los Angeles or San Francisco, or perhaps even in both cities. It also is considering building at most one new warehouse, but the choice of location is restricted to a city where a new factory is being built. The *net present value* (total profitability considering the time value of money) of each of these alternatives is shown in the table. The rightmost column gives the *capital required* (already included in the net present value) for the respective investments, where the total capital available is $10 million. The objective is to find the feasible combination of alternatives that maximizes the total net present value.

|                                   | Net Present Value | Capital Required |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Build factory in Los Angeles?     |     $9 million    |   $6 million     |
| Build factory in San Francisco?   |     $5 million    |   $3 million     |
| Build warehouse in Los Angeles?   |     $6 million    |   $5 million     |
| Build warehouse in San Francisco? |     $4 million    |   $2 million     |
