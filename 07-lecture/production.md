# Production planning

A company has seven products, each requiring a different production time per unit.
The company has 720 person-hours available next week and the production time and the profit per unit are given in the table below. 
  
| Product   | Person-hours per unit | Profit per unit |
|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Product 1 | 1.0                   | 10              |
| Product 2 | 2.0                   | 22              |
| Product 3 | 3.7                   | 35              |
| Product 4 | 2.4                   | 19              |
| Product 5 | 4.5                   | 55              |
| Product 6 | 0.7                   | 10              |
| Product 7 | 9.5                   | 115             |

The company's goal is to decide the mix of products which it should produce next week.

Formulate a generic problem formulation for optimising the profit for the company.

After proposing the generic formulation, the following requirements become known. Add these requirements to the formulation.

1. If product 7 is chosen for production an additional fixed cost of 2000 is incurred.
2. Each unit of product 2 that is produced over 100 units requires a production time of 3.0 person-hours instead of 2.0 person-hours.
3. Each unit of product 3 that is produced over 50 units will contribute to the total profit by 40 instead of 35 (economies of scale).
4. If both product 3 and product 4 are produced, 75 person-hours are needed for production line set-up.
