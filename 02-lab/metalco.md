# Metalco Company

The Metalco Company desires to blend a new alloy of 40 percent tin, 35 percent zinc, and 25 percent lead from several available alloys having the following properties:

| Property           | Alloy 1 | Alloy 2 | Alloy 3 | Alloy 4 | Alloy 5 |
|--------------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| Percentage of tin  | 60 | 25 | 45 | 20 | 50 |
| Percentage of zinc | 10 | 15 | 45 | 50 | 40 |
| Percentage of lead | 30 | 60 | 10 | 30 | 10 |
| Cost ($/lb)        | 77 | 70 | 88 | 84 | 94 |

The objective is to determine the proportions of these alloys that should be blended to produce the new alloy at a minimum cost.

1. Formulate a linear programming model for this problem.
2. Solve this model by the simplex method.
