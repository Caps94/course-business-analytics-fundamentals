The term **analytics** can be understood as the process of repeatedly or thoroughly breaking something down into its parts to understand it better. 

Applied to **business**, it implies the detailed and systematic breakdown of business operations to gain insight.

### Main types of Business Analytics

Analytics is used to tackle different questions related to business operations:

- Descriptive analytics: *What has happened?*
- Predictive analytics: *What will happen?*
- Prescriptive analytics: *What should be done?*

---

> **describe(v.)**
>
> mid-13c., descriven, <span style="background-color:yellow;">"interpret, explain,"</span> a sense now obsolete; c. 1300, "represent orally or by writing," from Old French descrivre, descrire (13c.) and directly from Latin describere "to write down, copy; sketch, represent," from de "down" (see de-) + scribere "to write" (from PIE root *skribh- "to cut").

From late 14c. as "form or trace by motion;" c. 1400 as "delineate or mark the form or figure of, outline." Reconstructed with Latin spelling from c. 1450. Related: Described, describes, describing.

> **predict(v.)**
>
> 1620s (implied in predicted), <span style="background-color:yellow;">"foretell, prophesy, declare before the event happens,"</span> a back formation from prediction or else from Latin praedicatus, past participle of praedicere "foretell, advise, give notice," from prae "before" (see pre-) + dicere "to say" (from PIE root *deik- "to show," also "pronounce solemnly"). Related: Predicted; predicting.

> **prescribe(v.)**
>
> mid-15c., prescriben, <span style="background-color:yellow;">"to write down as a direction, law, or rule,"</span> from Latin praescribere "write before, prefix in writing; ordain, determine in advance," from prae "before" (see pre-) + scribere "to write" (from PIE root *skribh- "to cut"). Related: Prescribed; prescribing. Medical sense of "advise, appoint, or designate as a remedy for a disease" is from 1580s, probably a back formation from prescription.

Sometimes similar methodologies are used for all three types.

For example, recommender systems may serve all purposes.

| Analytics type | Recommendation type                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Descriptive    | "People who bought this, also bought ..."   |
| Predictive     | "Based on your search, you might like ..."  |
| Prescriptive   | "We propose ... to you"                     |

If descriptive analytics ("*What has happened?*")  is combined with causal inference, we can also answer the question "*Why did it happen?*". This is sometimes referred to as **Diagnostic analytics**.

Other terms can also be found, but they often overlap with the main three types.

===

## Descriptive analytics  

Descriptive analytics is the process of using **current and historical data** to identify patterns and events. 

---

### Naive approaches

Basic techniques in descriptive analytics include simple, summary statistics:

- **Counts:** number of records, frequency of categories
- **Mean and median:** measures of central tendency
- **Standard deviation:** measure of variability
- **Minimum and maximum:** range of values

These are often used to get a quick understanding of the dataset before applying more advanced methods.
